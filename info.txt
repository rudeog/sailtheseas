todo:
- Save/load should include random number info so we get proper generation
- Bypass intro by supplying cmd line args
- come up with a way to render the world map in chunks or something, this would allow us to make a bigger world
- separate log output
- ability to pawn off something you don't want at a lower price
  - pawn command lists prices that will be paid
  - pawn code will get rid of that item yielding the lower price

travel:
Moving between squares takes time. Each square represents a degree of lat/long and is 60 nautical miles in length.
When you are at an island you are always in the center of a square. When you enter a square, you will ALWAYS move
to the center of that square before moving to another square.
Therefore you are always moving toward center or away from center. If you change direction and you are moving toward
center at the time, you will first complete your motion toward the center before moving away from center.

save:
save data is json and is loaded in 2 phases. first phase loads info that doesn't rely on the map. then the map
is generated based on the saved seed, then the rest of the data (trade data, visited data) is loaded
