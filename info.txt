travel:
Moving between squares takes time. Each square represents a degree of lat/long and is 60 nautical miles in length.
When you are at an island you are always in the center of a square. When you enter a square, you will ALWAYS move
to the center of that square before moving to another square.
Therefore you are always moving toward center or away from center. If you change direction and you are moving toward
center at the time, you will first complete your motion toward the center before moving away from center.
