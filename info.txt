todo:
- Save/load
- Bypass intro by supplying cmd line args
- come up with a way to render the world map in chunks or something, this would allow us to make a bigger world
- separate log output
- nicer formatting on command list
- get rid of nested commands if possible:
  - combine map local with islands local
  - islands will now list all visited and local islands
  - describe should only apply to island
  - ship command will replace describe ship
- maybe do a describe island implicitly when entering its waters
- ability to pawn off something you don't want at a lower price
  - pawn command lists prices that will be paid
  - pawn code will get rid of that item yielding the lower price





period facts:
1 knot is 1 nautical mile per hour
merchant ships at this time could sail at a speed of 4 to 8 knots
a good telescope might extend visibility to several miles, possibly up to 10 miles or more under favorable conditions.
The largest merchant ships were the East Indiamen, in three broad classes, of 1200 tons, 800 tons, or 500 tons.

travel:
Moving between squares takes time. Each square represents a degree of lat/long and is 60 nautical miles in length.
When you are at an island you are always in the center of a square. When you enter a square, you will ALWAYS move
to the center of that square before moving to another square.
Therefore you are always moving toward center or away from center. If you change direction and you are moving toward
center at the time, you will first complete your motion toward the center before moving away from center.
